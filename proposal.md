# Capstone project proposals

## Proposal 1

Null hypothesis- There is no internal error from the measurement of the stars caused by the Hubble Space Telescope.

Alternate hypothesis- There is internal error caused by the Hubble Space Telescope.

I'm going to be using the data about each of the stars from the globular cluster 47 Tuc (NGC 104) and determining the error (or lack of) caused by the telescope itself. Other external factors such as the dust caused by our milky way and the distance to the globular cluster itself will be considered in order to reduce the error given by the surrounding Universe. I will then compare the data to a model with which the data is suppoed t follow to see how much the data differs from this model. While cleaning, I will have to take into consideration abnormal stars that would reduce the size of the error.

## Proposal 2

Null hypothesis- The stress level of a person in academia stays the same regardless of position or field of study. 

Alternative hypothesis- Stress level of academics increases as they advance through the ranks.

This dataset categorizes different fields in academia and tries to determine their stress level and happiness according to their position (Ph.D. student, tenure position, etc.).

## Proposal 3

Null hypothesis- There is no correlation between the amount of songs released in a specific genre along with the popularity of that song.

Alternate hypothesis- There is a positive correlation between the amount of songs released in a genre compared to the popularity of said genre. 

For this data set, I would be comparing the different genres of music along with their popularity. There is a lot of different variables that are compared including the liveliness and acousticness of the song that might affect how popular a song is.
